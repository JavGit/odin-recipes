 <h3>Ingredients</h3>
 <ul>
     <li>4 thick-cut pork chops</li>
     <li>1 teaspoon Montreal steak seasoning, or as desired</li>
     <li>1/2 cup of butter, divided</li>
     <li>2 1/2 tablespoons of all-purpose flour, or as needed</li>
     <li>1 tablespoon dried basil</li>
     <li>1 teaspoon instant beef bouillon granules</li>
     <li>1 teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper</li>
     <li>2 cups of milk</li>
 </ul>
 <h3>Steps</h3>
 <ol>
     <li>Season pork chops on all sides with Montreal steak seasoning.</li>
     <li>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook chops in melted butter until browned and slightly pink in the center, about 7 to 10 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Add remaining butter to the pan as needed so that about 3 tablespoons pan drippings remain in the pan when the chops are finished cooking. Transfer pork chops to a plate and return skillet to medium-high heat.</li>
     <li>Mix flour, basil, and beef bouillon together in a bowl. Stir black pepper into skillet with the pan drippings and cook for 1 minute. Add flour mixture and cook, stirring constantly, until browned, about 2 minutes. Pour milk into flour mixture; cook and stir constantly until mixture is thick and bubbly, 4 to 6 minutes. Pour sauce over pork chops and serve.</li>
